## Discord Bot Project - Casino

This project contains the initial code for a Discord Gambling bot.

**Current Features:**

- **engine.py:** This file defines a `gamble()` function that is not yet implemented.
- **main.py:** This file sets up the basic Discord bot structure using the `discord.py` library.

**To Use:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py
   ```
2. **Complete the `gamble()` function in `engine.py`.**
3. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Future Development:**

- Implement the `gamble()` function with desired functionality.
- Add more commands and features to the bot.
- Customize the bot's behavior and appearance.

**Note:** This project is a starting point and needs further development to be functional.
